### Problem Statement 
- Every business strives to project future trends for their key performance indicators, such as sales, profits, and gains. This pursuit is driven by the desire to gauge the popularity of specific products and understand how their sales can influence overall business success.
- Each product category possesses distinct characteristics and caters to different customer segments. A comprehensive analysis of past performance uncovers valuable insights, allowing businesses to discern prevailing trends.
- To this end, we will construct a forecast model aimed at predicting furniture sales for a store.

### Approach 
- To forecast the sales, I will employ 'Time Series Analysis' models, namely ARIMA and SARIMAX, and perform a comparative analysis of their outputs. Furthermore, I will utilize the chosen model to predict sales for the period spanning from 2018 to 2020.

### Libraries Used
